We can also use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to calculate the band structure of graphene. DFT uses a set of self-consistent equations, namely the Kohn-Sham equations to iteratively determine the ground state energy of a given system. For the following band structure calculations, a PBE functional pseudopotential was used for Quantum Espresso.

An initial relaxation step was performed to determine the optimized system and slightly alter the atomic positions and lattice vectors accordingly. A self-consistent calculation was then performed followed by a bands calculation. Finally, a post-processing step was done to obtain a plot-able band structure output file.
