# graphene_gnr_bandstructures
This is a set of tutorials and codes that will help you compute the band structures of 2D graphene, graphene nanoribbons and stacked graphene layers using tight-binding models and DFT!!

The files are separated into code and tutorial files. Each code file (folder) corresponds to a tutorial by number (code_#_xyz and tutorial_#_xyz)
