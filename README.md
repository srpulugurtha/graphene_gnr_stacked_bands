# graphene_gnr_bandstructures
This is a set of tutorials and codes that will help you compute the band structures of 2D graphene, graphene nanoribbons and stacked graphene layers using tight-binding models and DFT!!

The files are separated into code and tutorial files. Each code file (folder) corresponds to a tutorial by number (code_#_xyz and tutorial_#_xyz):

Codes and Tutorials:
1. Band structure of graphene using a tight-binding model
2. Band structure of graphene using DFT
3. Band structure of graphene nanoribbons using a tight-binding model
4. Band structure of bi-layer graphene using a tight-binding model
5. Band structure of graphene nanoribbons using DFT
